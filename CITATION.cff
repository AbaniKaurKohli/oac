abstract: >-
  OpenAirClim is a model for simplified evaluation of the
  approximate chemistry-climate impact of air traffic
  emissions. The model represents the major responses of the
  atmosphere to emissions in terms of composition and
  climate change. Instead of applying time-consuming
  climate-chemistry models, a response model is developed
  and applied which reproduces the response of a
  climate-chemistry model without actually calculating ab
  initio all the physical and chemical effects. The
  responses are non-linear relations between localized
  emissions and Radiative Forcing and further climate
  indicators. These response surfaces are contained within
  look-up tables.
